# Technical Debt & Deferred Items

This folder tracks items that don't fit the current development phase but should be
reconsidered later:

- **Technical debt** — shortcuts taken that need future attention
- **Deferred decisions** — items marked "to be reconsidered later"
- **Out-of-scope enhancements** — good ideas that don't fit current priorities

These items don't directly advance the planned development phases but shouldn't be
forgotten.

## Current Items
